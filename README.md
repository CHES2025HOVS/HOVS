## 5. Event Abstract

Emerging techniques, such as AI, smart IoTs and high performance chips, have significantly enhanced vehicle intelligence and connectivity. While it makes smart cars approaching L4 autonomous driving, the enlarged attack surface has consequently led to an exponential expansion of security risks. Although plenty of classic cybersecurity techniques have been applied on smart vehicles, customized systematic security designs and tests for the intelligent vehicles are still in a lack. We propose organizing the workshop to bring experts from academia, industry, and regulatory bodies, for exchanging ideas and sharing the latest advancements on this platform.

The workshop will cover:

### Theme 1: Industry Practices and Security Frameworks

Centered on practical demands from intelligent vehicle manufacturers, this session will systematically examine mainstream vehicle information security frameworks (e.g., distributed security architectures, centralized protection platforms) and analyze their limitations in hardware-layer implementations. Discussions will emphasize standardization strategies to enhance intrinsic security capabilities of in-vehicle hardware systems.

### Theme 2: Cutting-Edge Research and Technological Breakthroughs

From a research perspective, this session will explore several critical technological domains: 1) vehicle security chips: design of high-reliability, low-power hardware trust roots and automotive-grade certification mechanisms. 2) Data-bus intrusion detection: real-time detection of multimodal sensor data and anomaly detection techniques. 3) Human-vehicle interaction privacy: privacy leakage prevention for biometric and voice-controlled interaction hardware. 4) Environmental perception reliability: anti-physical interference and data integrity verification for LiDAR, cameras, and other perception hardware.

This workshop aims to foster interdisciplinary collaboration, bringing together researchers, engineers, and policymakers to discuss cutting-edge solutions for securing intelligent vehicle systems. By facilitating technical discussions and knowledge sharing, this event will contribute to the advancement of next-generation secure automotive chips, ultimately enhancing the safety and trustworthiness of intelligent vehicles.

## 6. Submission process: not applicable

## 7. Estimated number of attendees:

We anticipate a total of approximately 50 attendees, including around 20 experts from academia, industry, and regulatory bodies, as well as approximately 30 student participants. The event is expected to attract a significant number of students, given the growing interest in automotive security, intelligent vehicle technologies, and secure chip design. The participation of experts will provide valuable insights and guidance, fostering knowledge exchange and collaboration between industry professionals and the next generation of researchers and engineers.
