                        Emerging techniques, such as AI, smart IoTs and high performance chips, 
                        have significantly enhanced vehicle intelligence and connectivity. 
                        While it makes smart cars approaching L4 autonomous driving, 
                        the enlarged attack surface has consequently led to an exponential 
                        expansion of security risks. Although plenty of classic cybersecurity 
                        techniques have been applied on smart vehicles, customized systematic 
                        security designs and tests for the intelligent vehicles are still in a lack. 
                        We propose organizing the workshop to bring experts from academia, industry, 
                        and regulatory bodies, for exchanging ideas and sharing the latest advancements 
                        on this platform.
